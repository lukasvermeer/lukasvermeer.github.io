**Abstract:**
Online controlled experiments (also known as A/B tests) are widely used to evaluate new ideas and measure their impact. At Booking.com, we have built an experimentation infrastructure and culture that enables anyone in the company to run experiments and make data-driven decisions. This paper describes the technical and organizational challenges we faced, the solutions we implemented, and the lessons we learned from democratizing experimentation at scale.
